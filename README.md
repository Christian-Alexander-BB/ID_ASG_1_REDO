This project attempts to prototype a new structure of the website for the company SpaceX, which is an aerospace engineering company. The prototype is of 3 pages, and it is what the entire website will look like if the design is accepted by the company. The 3 pages are of the home page, Falcon 9 Rocket page, and Falcon Heavy rocket page.

 
## Design Process

This website is for the company SpaceX, who wants to let more people know what their company does either for business prospects or to satisfy the public's curiosity.

This project is designed in such a way to be aesthetically and functionally appealing to the audience of this company. It is designed to show professionalism through web design and to help achieve the goal of the company - To make the public more interested in space exploration and aerospace in general, similar to how they were interested in the first manned mission to the moon. 

User stories:

  aerospace technology to be used more by organizations and thus, make profit.
