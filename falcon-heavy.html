                    <p id="dark-background">
                        Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift 
                        into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb) Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next 
                        closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy. Falcon Heavy is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores
                        whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to 
                        approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.

                    <h3>Description</h3>

                    <p>
                        Three cores make up the first stage of Falcon Heavy. The side cores, or boosters, 
                        are connected on the nosecone, the interstage, and on the octaweb. Shortly after liftoff the center 
                        core engines are throttled down. After the side cores separate, the center core engines throttle back 
                        up to full thrust.

                    <p>
                        The Falcon Heavy first stage is equipped with 12 landing legs (4 on each booster) made of state-of-the-art 
                        carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb. All 12 landing legs are stowed along the side of each booster until 
                        just prior to landing.

                    <p>
                        Falcon Heavy draws upon Falcon 9’s proven design, which minimizes stage separation events and maximizes 
                        reliability. The second-stage Merlin Vacuum Engine delivers the rocket’s payload to orbit after the main 
                        engines cut off and the first-stage cores separate.

                    <p>
                        The interstage is a composite structure that connects the center core on the first stage and second stages and 
                        holds the release and separation system.
                        <br><br>
                        Falcon Heavy is equipped with 12 hypersonic grid fins, four on each booster, positioned at the base of the 
                        interstage or nosecone which orients by moving the center of pressure during reentry.

                    <p>
                        With more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, Falcon Heavy is the most capable rocket flying. 
                        By comparison, the liftoff thrust of the Falcon Heavy equals approximately eighteen 747 aircraft at full 
                        power. Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner—complete with passengers, luggage
                        and fuel—to orbit.

                        The culmination of SpaceX's research and testing of Falcon Heavy is the launch of Starman. Starman is a dummy
                        in a SpaceX spacesuit that was positioned sitting on Elon Musk's personal Tesla Roadster. It was launched into 
                        an orbit around the Sun (including the car) which will then end up passing by Mars and reaching 
                        the asteroid belt. This was Falcon Heavy's first launch.

                    <p>
                        Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use on its Falcon series of 
                        launch vehicles. It is designed with recovery and reusability in mind. Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid 
                        oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas-generator power cycle.
                        The Merlin engine was originally designed for recovery and reuse.
